# Edith, Watch This!

The starter files for this project were cloned from **Angular Essential Training**  , a tutorial I coded-along with to for my first venture into using Angular.
The full course is available at [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning) and [lynda.com](https://lynda.com).

## Project

It is my intention to refactor these files to build something uniquely mine. Using the starter files as a starting point allows me the opportunity to learn Angular by refactoring the code base, without the stress of building something from stratch, for my first Angular project. 

## Project scope and MVP goals

The project build in the **Angular Essential Training** was a media watch list where a user could manually add a film or TV series to a list and mark them as watched or favorited. 

To fullfil my vision of the "Edith, Watch This!" project, where any user can add a movie or TV series to reccomend to me to watch, I intend to refactor the code base the following ways, roughly in this order of goal achievement:

1. A complete styling overhaul that is more modern and to my personal liking. 

2. Adding a back-end database (likely, Firebase) to allow data to persist. 

3. Adding an API call to a Media Database to link to real data about Movies.

4. Adding an account login for myself to be able to mark movies as watched or favorited.

Wish me luck.
